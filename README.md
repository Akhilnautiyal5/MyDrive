## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Storage**: Appwrite
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **File Handling**: Multer (for file uploads)
- **Template Engine**: EJS

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MongoDB (for database)
- Appwrite account (for storage and authentication)
- npm or yarn (for package management)

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my-drive.git
cd my-drive
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set up the environment variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following configuration:

```env
CONNECTION_STRING=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=your_appwrite_endpoint
APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your_appwrite_project_id
APPWRITE_API_KEY=your_appwrite_api_key
APPWRITE_BUCKET_ID=your_appwrite_bucket_id
PORT=3001
```

Make sure to replace `your_mongodb_connection_string`, `your_jwt_secret`, and Appwrite-related values with your actual credentials and details. You can get these from your Appwrite console.

### 4. Start the server
Once your environment is set up, you can start the application using:

```bash
npm start
```

The application should be running locally on [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001).

## Usage

1. **Register/Login**: 
   - Register for a new account or login with existing credentials. 
   - JWT tokens are used to authenticate users.

2. **Upload Files**:
   - Use the "Upload File" button or drag and drop files into the application interface.
   - Files up to 50MB in size can be uploaded (Appwrite's free tier limitation).

3. **View Uploaded Files**:
   - After uploading, your files will be displayed in a file gallery where you can preview or download them.

4. **Download Files**:
   - Click on any file to view its details or download it to your local device.

5. **File Details**:
   - View metadata for each uploaded file, including the file name, size, and upload time.

6. **Delete Files**:
   - Remove files from the storage by clicking on the delete option in the three-dot menu in each file.

## Limitations

- Maximum file size: 50MB (due to Appwrite free-tier storage limits)
- Storage space is based on Appwrite free-tier limits
- No preview for files other than images(png, jpeg, etc.)
